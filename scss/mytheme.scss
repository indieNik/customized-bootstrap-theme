*                                   * BASE
*       Base rules are the defaults.
*       They are almost exclusively single element selectors but it could include attribute selectors,
*       pseudo-class selectors, child selectors or sibling selectors.
*       Essentially, a base style says that wherever this element is on the page, it should look like this.
*       
*       Examples of Base Styles
*       
*       html, body, form { margin: 0; padding: 0; }
*       input[type=text] { border: 1px solid #999; }
*       a { color: #039; }
*       a:hover { color: #03C; }
*                                   * LAYOUTS
*       Layout rules divide the page into sections. Layouts hold one or more modules together.
*       
*                                   * MODULES
*       Modules are the reusable, modular parts of our design.
*       They are the callouts, the sidebar sections, the product lists and so on.
*       
*                                   * STATE
*       State rules are ways to describe how our modules or layouts will look when in a particular state.
*       Is it hidden or expanded? Is it active or inactive? They are about describing how a module or layout looks
*       on screens that are smaller or bigger. They are also about describing how a module might look in
*       different views like the home page or the inside page.
*       
*                                   * THEME
*       Finally, Theme rules are similar to state rules in that they describe how modules or layouts might look.
*       Most sites donâ€™t require a layer of theming but it is good to be aware of it.
